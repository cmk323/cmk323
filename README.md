- ðŸŒ¸ Hi! Iâ€™m Mae.
- ðŸŒ¸ Iâ€™m a biochemist by training interested in computational structural biology. My research area of interest is machine learning applications for computer-aided drug discovery.
- ðŸŒ¸ Iâ€™m currently learning Python for use in analyzing biochemical data.
- ðŸŒ¸ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on bioinformatics and computational biology projects. I especially enjoy working with those from more computational backgrounds to help make sense of biological and chemical data.
